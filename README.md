# Repository Archive

This repository contains the source files of repositories found on [the website](https://dohack.me).

Files here are already public source, and links to their source can be found in the respective folders. Some repository sources may be omitted out of copyright/privacy/respect issues.

Files may be rearranged so that the folder structure stays relatively consistent. Some Dockerfiles may get additional steps (mostly exposing ports) to be compatible with [orchestrator](https://github.com/dohack-me/orchestrator).

Some files that are not part of the challenge or the image building process may be deleted (the amount of gdb history files is insane)

As of now, challenges requiring multiple containers are not supported. Affected challenges will be listed in each repository.
