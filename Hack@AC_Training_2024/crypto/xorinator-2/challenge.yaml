  Curse you, Marcus the Duck!

  This time round I have increased my secret key length to be 14 bytes long!

  In addition, most of the characters in the message are now non-printable ASCII.

  The only hint that I will give you is that the string "0iwMIGhTMfd8ti" appears in the message.

  Let's see if you can still decode the message to get the flag!
flag: ACSI{sliding_wind0w_techniqu3_is_extr3m3ly_OP!!!}
