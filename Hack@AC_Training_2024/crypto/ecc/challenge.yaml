title: Extended Carrot Conjecture

  There's something mysterious about carrots.  
  We talk about their color, their taste, their texture, and the funny way they tend to "spin" when you peel one.  
  Most of the time we don't bother.  
  Cousin Karl helped himself to a fresh one this morning, but discovered it didn't have much flavor.  
  Why do we grow carrots anyway?  
  That's the problem I come to struggle with.  
  But I'm sure I'm not the only one.  

  Recently, I've been working on an Extended Carrot Conjecture that will finally settle this problem. I just need someone
  to help me prove it. Believe it or not, I have managed to model the carrot mystery as an Elliptic Curve with the formula
  as shown in the attachment.

  All you need to do is calculate the private key, and use it as a key to decrypt the following ciphertext encoded in AES (ECB Mode):
  `8409b13eb773b3fa396799b35541e923f793f9c694e7d089354c6c04f3b1921e99ed5e803b2b81dac64d099b517d88666a2bec925df6483b17eb0be0f05958c4`  
  This will provide you with a flag to prove to me that you've cracked the code.
  Go forth, and solve this mystery.
